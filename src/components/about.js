      <h1>About Data Dashboard</h1>
      <p>
        Our team's project for the NYC Coders Black Lives Matter Hackathon is to
        create a data dashboard for shooting incidents throughout NYC utilizing
        NYC Open Data. We wanted to show the differences in victims between
        communities in NYC. Communities of color often suffer from many forms of
        oppression including but not limited to, over policing and police
        brutality. With this tool users can explore shooting incidences
        throughout the five borooughs and understand the racial breakdown of
        victims. We hope that with this information, people gain a greater
        understanding of the disparities present in our society.
